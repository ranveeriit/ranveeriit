I am an Assistant Professor in the [Discipline of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Indore](http://cse.iiti.ac.in/)


# Research Interests
I broadly work in spectral graph theory, that is, the study of graphs using the matrices associated with graphs like adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, Seidel matrix, etc. The two problem I am primarily interested in are
 - the constructions of the [expander graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph#:~:text=In%20combinatorics%2C%20an%20expander%20graph,vertex%2C%20edge%20or%20spectral%20expansion.) and in particular explicit construction of [Ramanujan graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_graph) which are the best possible expanders.
   - For more detail see the excellent survey by [Hoory, Linial, Wigderson](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nati/PAPERS/expander_survey.pdf)
 - [matrix determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) (P) vs [matrix permanent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)) (#P-complete) problem. 
   - For more detail see articles by [Manindra Agrawal](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/survey/Determinant.pdf) and [Frank Ban](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/ban275.pdf)
   
Apart from above two problems, I am trying to explore the area of [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#:~:text=Quantum%20computing%20is%20the%20use,are%20known%20as%20quantum%20computers.), feel free to ping me for the discussions on it.

**For the students who want to work with me:** please drop me an email if your are interested in the following reasearch areas: *Algorithmic Graphs (Matrix) Theory, Computational Complexity, Complex network analysis*.

**An advertisement for JRF position:** see the advertisement titled "Reducing parameterized complexities of matrix determinant and permanents"[here](http://iiti.ac.in/recruitments/jrf-srf-positions)

For some open problem proposed by me see [Mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/users/91089/ranveer-singh). For some interesting read and ideas see [Medium](https://medium.com/).
