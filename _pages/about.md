Research Area:  I broadly work in spectral graph theory, that is, the study of graphs using the associated matrices like adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, Seidel matrix, etc. At present, I am working on
 (1) the constructions of the expander graphs and in particular explicit construction of Ramanujan graphs which are the best possible expander graphs.
 (2) Matrix determinant (P) vs Matrix permanent (#P-complete) problem.
