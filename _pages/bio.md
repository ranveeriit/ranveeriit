I completed my B.Tech in the year 2012 from IIT Jodhpur in Computer Science
and Engineering, and the initial two years of B.Tech I was at IIT Kanpur.
I completed my Ph.D. in July 2018 from IIT Jodhpur in the Department of
Mathematics and the thesis title is A measure of balance, spectra of signed
graphs, and a novel algorithm for matrix determinant and permanent". During
my Ph.D. one year I was a visiting scholar at IIT Kharagpur in the department of
mathematics, where I worked on the degree of balancedness of signed networks. I worked
with Prof. RB Bapat at ISI- Delhi on determinant and permanent of matrices
using blocks in the digraphs during my Ph.D. From December 2017- October
2019, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology
in the Department of Mathematics under Emeritus Prof. Abraham Berman.
During my postdoc tenure, I worked on characterisation of nonsingular block
graphs and graphs those are determined by their Seidel eigenvalues. In December
2109 I joined IIT Dhanbad as a visiting assistant professor in the Department
of Computer Science and Engineering. In research currently, I am working on
the construction of Expanders graphs, in particular, Ramanujan Graphs.
