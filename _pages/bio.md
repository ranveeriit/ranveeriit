I completed my B.Tech in the year 2012 from [IIT Jodhpur](http://www.iitj.ac.in/) in Computer Science
and Engineering, and the initial two years of B.Tech I was at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).
I completed my Ph.D. in July 2018 from [IIT Jodhpur](http://www.iitj.ac.in/) in the Department of
Mathematics and the thesis title is **A measure of balance, spectra of signed
graphs, and a novel algorithm for matrix determinant and permanent**. During
my Ph.D. one year I was a visiting scholar at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in the Department of
Mathematics, where I worked on the degree of balancedness of signed networks. During my Ph.D., I also worked
with [Prof. RB Bapat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Bapat) (*ISI- Delhi*) on determinant and permanent of matrices
using blocks in the digraphs. From December 2017- October
2019, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Technion-Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/)
in the Department of Mathematics under [Emeritus Prof. Abraham Berman](http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~berman/).
During my postdoc tenure, I worked on characterisation of nonsingular block
graphs and graphs those are determined by their Seidel eigenvalues. In June 2020 I joined [IIT Indore](https://www.iiti.ac.in/) as an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
